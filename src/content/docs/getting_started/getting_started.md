# Welcome to AgentLogos

This is not just another AI documentation site. It's a **personal braindump** of everything I've learned about building AI agents that actually work in the real world.

## Why This Exists

After years of working with AI agents—reading papers, experimenting with frameworks, and most importantly, **putting agents into production**—I realized my knowledge was scattered everywhere. Notes in Notion, bookmarks I could never find again, code snippets buried in random repos.

AgentLogos is my solution: a centralized vault for everything that matters when building intelligent systems.

## What You'll Find Here

This knowledge base focuses on **what works**, not what's trendy:

- **Production-tested patterns** — Real architectures that scale
- **Hard-earned lessons** — Mistakes I made so you don't have to
- **Practical prompting** — Beyond basic ChatGPT tricks
- **Tool integration** — How to give agents actual capabilities
- **System design** — Structuring agents for reliability

## Philosophy

> *"The map is not the territory."* — Alfred Korzybski

Frameworks change. Models get replaced. What remains constant are the **core principles** of building intelligent systems that solve real problems.

If something is documented here, it's because I've used it, tested it, and believe it's valuable.

## How to Navigate

Use the **sidebar** to explore topics. The documentation is organized by sections:

- Start with foundational concepts
- Dive into specific patterns when needed
- Reference code examples as you build

This is a living document. It evolves as I learn and as the field advances.
