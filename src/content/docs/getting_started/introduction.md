# What is AgentLogos?

AgentLogos is a **personal knowledge vault** dedicated to the art and science of building AI agents that solve real-world problems.

This isn't a comprehensive encyclopedia. It's a curated collection of insights, patterns, and practices that I've found essential in my journey building production AI systems.

## Core Focus Areas

### Agents in Production

Theory is easy. Production is hard. This vault focuses on:

- Reliability patterns for non-deterministic systems
- Error handling and graceful degradation
- Monitoring and observability
- Cost optimization without sacrificing quality

### Advanced Prompting

Beyond "write me a poem about cats":

- Structured reasoning techniques
- Context window optimization
- Few-shot learning patterns
- Prompt engineering for specific tasks

### System Architecture

How to structure agents that scale:

- Tool use and function calling
- Memory and context management
- Multi-agent orchestration
- Integration patterns with existing systems

### Practical Patterns

Real code, real examples:

- Reusable templates
- Common pitfalls and solutions
- Performance optimization
- Security considerations

## The Philosophy

AI engineering is still in its infancy. We're all figuring this out as we go. What separates successful implementations from failed experiments often comes down to:

1. **Understanding the fundamentals** — Models change, principles don't
2. **Testing in production** — Real users expose edge cases you never imagined
3. **Iterating quickly** — The best prompt is the one you shipped yesterday and improved today
4. **Staying pragmatic** — Use the simplest solution that solves the problem

## Who This Is For

This vault is primarily for me—a way to organize and access my own knowledge. But if you're:

- Building AI agents for production
- Tired of tutorial hell and want real-world patterns
- Looking for battle-tested approaches
- Interested in the messy reality of AI engineering

Then you might find value here too.
