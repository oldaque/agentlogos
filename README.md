## Why does this repository exist?

Over the past few years, I've been diving deep into the world of AI agents. I've read papers, watched talks, experimented with frameworks, wrestled with prompts, and most importantly: **put agents into production**.

The problem? Knowledge was scattered everywhere. Notes in Notion, lost bookmarks, snippets in random repositories, insights I vaguely remembered writing down "somewhere".

**AgentLogos** is my solution to that.

## What you'll find here

This is not a generic tutorial. It's a **personal vault** focused on:

- **Patterns that work** — Things I actually use in production
- **Lessons learned** — Mistakes I made so you don't have to repeat them
- **Agent architectures** — How to structure systems that scale
- **Advanced prompting** — Beyond the basics, techniques that make a difference
- **Tools and integrations** — The ecosystem I trust

## Philosophy

> *"The map is not the territory."* — Alfred Korzybski

Frameworks change. Models evolve. What remains are the **fundamental principles** of how to build intelligent systems that solve real problems.

My focus here is on what works in the real world, not what's hype. If something is in this repository, it's because I use it, tested it, and believe it's worth sharing.

## Contributing

This is a personal project, but knowledge grows when shared.

If you:
- Found an error or outdated information
- Have a suggestion for improvement
- Want to share an insight or experience
- Know a pattern that should be here

**Open an issue or PR.** All contributions are welcome.
